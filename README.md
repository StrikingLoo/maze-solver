An implementation of Sarsa from the ground up can be found in train.py, whereas Maze.py is a particular challenge for it.
If you don't touch anything and just modify the list of blocked squares in the last lines of train.py, you can design new labyrinths and see if the AI can solve them! 
You will also have to change the goal position and, possibly, starting place, each in a single line.
